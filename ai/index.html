      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>
        The field of Artificial Intelligence is huge. It consists of various
        subsets that have recently gotten more attention. The biggest subset
        is Machine Learning, specifically Deep Learning. Here I provide some
        examples of the applications of Deep Learning.

      <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>
        There are several frameworks to exercise machine learning; one of them
        is TensorFlow. This framework was created by Google and is now one of
        the top machine learning frameworks. Below are a few videos showing
        some of the things that can be done with TensorFlow.

            I trained a recurrent neural network (RRN) on lyrics of Green Day.
            Here are some lyrics the model generated after being trained.
